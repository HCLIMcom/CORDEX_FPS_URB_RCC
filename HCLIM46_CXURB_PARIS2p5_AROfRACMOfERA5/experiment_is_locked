    RACMO fixes from CORDEX-FPS-URB-RCC (Hirlam/HCLIM#195)
    
    * Make SST_MODEL in Interpol_sst* scripts case insensitive
    * Echo file names when archiving netcdf files to ECFS
    * Add RACMO as host model to PREP for garden
    * Always allow to run with updating SST/SIC for RACMO
    * Add @XM@ macro to fill in decade (10 day period in month, 1: 1-10, 2:11-20, 3: >= 21), Needed to untar RACMO boundaries
    * For @XM@ add perl ceil and min also to parse4mars.pl, which uses Boundary_strategy.pm
    * Change macro for decade from @XM@ to @X@; only 1 digit used
