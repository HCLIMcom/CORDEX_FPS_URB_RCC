# CORDEX_FPS_URB_RCC

- Experiment created based on the HCLIM46_develop Commits on July 18, 2025 (Commit c68d367)
- These setup are used: NPATCH=3, NHINCSOL=4, 'Dry Soil Layer' activated by default (see nam/surfex_namelists.pm).
- We still need to get in the fix for the latent heat flux, once that has been approved in NWP.

## RACMO nested experiments:
