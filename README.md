# CORDEX_FPS_URB_RCC

- Experiment created based on the HCLIM46_develop Commits on May 6, 2025: feature ERA5.1 (8946f6668fd559e6ebef6b8f6d237a74acde2f6c)
- These setup are used: NPATCH=3, NHINCSOL=4, 'Dry Soil Layer' activated by default (see nam/surfex_namelists.pm).
- We still need to get in the fix for the latent heat flux, once that has been approved in NWP.
